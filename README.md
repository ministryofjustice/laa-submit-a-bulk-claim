# Submit a Bulk Claim
[![Ministry of Justice Repository Compliance Badge](https://github-community.service.justice.gov.uk/repository-standards/api/laa-submit-a-bulk-claim/badge)](https://github-community.service.justice.gov.uk/repository-standards/laa-cwa-bulk-upload)

Submit a Bulk Claim is a Spring Boot web application that enables Legal Aid Agency providers to upload and track claims in bulk. 
The service authenticates users via Sign into LAA Services (SILAS), orchestrates validation and processing through the Data Stewardship `data-claims-api`, and surfaces submission feedback through a lightweight web UI.

## Overview
- Securely capture, validate, and submit bulk claims for providers authorised via SILAS.
- Surface submission progress, validation results, and historic uploads via search workflows.
- Integrate with downstream services through client libraries generated from the `data-claims-api`.

## Key Capabilities
- Guided bulk file upload with validation, virus scanning, and provider scoping.
- In-progress polling for submission status as the Data Stewardship platform processes files.
- Search and pagination for previous submissions with detailed status and error summaries.
- Role-aware error handling and feedback aligned to GOV.UK design guidance.

## Integrations
- **SILAS (Sign into LAA Services)** – Production authentication relies on Azure AD SILAS tenants. Locally, use the [laa-oidc-mock-server](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-oidc-mock-server) to emulate SILAS OIDC flows.
- **Data Stewardship `data-claims-api`** – REST client (`DataClaimsRestClient`) fetches submission summaries, claim details, and validation messages. Data transfer objects are supplied via the shared data stewardship model packages.
- **WireMock stubs** – Local testing depends on WireMock mappings in `wiremock/mappings` to simulate Data Stewardship responses and avoid touching live infrastructure.
- **MapStruct mappers** – DTOs are mapped to UI view models via MapStruct components in `laa-submit-a-bulk-claim-ui/src/main/java/uk/gov/justice/laa/bulkclaim/mapper`.

## Architecture
- **Presentation layer** – Spring MVC controllers orchestrate upload (`BulkImportController`), polling (`BulkImportInProgressController`), search (`SearchController`), and detail pages.
- **Service and helper layer** – Validators, pagination helpers, and OIDC utilities encapsulate business rules and session handling.
- **Clients** – Declarative Spring `@HttpExchange` clients wrap the Data Stewardship API with non-blocking WebClient calls.
- **View templates** – Thymeleaf templates render forms, dashboards, and error states.
- **Security** – Spring Security OIDC handles SILAS authentication; client credentials access the Data Stewardship API.

## Tech Stack
- Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring WebFlux clients
- Thymeleaf, HTMX, and GOV.UK Design System components
- Gradle build tooling
- MapStruct for DTO/view-model mapping
- JUnit 5, MockMvc, and Mockito for automated testing
- Docker & Docker Compose for local dependencies

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)
- Docker Desktop for dependency containers
- GitHub Packages credentials configured for the [`laa-ccms-spring-boot-gradle-plugin`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-ccms-spring-boot-common?tab=readme-ov-file#provide-your-repository-credentials)

### Configure External Dependencies
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/submit-a-bulk-claim.git
   cd submit-a-bulk-claim
   ```
2. **Start Data Stewardship WireMocks**
   ```sh
    docker-compose up claim-service
   ```
   - WireMock listens on `http://localhost:8091` using stubs from `wiremock/mappings/claim-service`.
   

3. **Run the SILAS OIDC mock**
   - Included in docker-compose as `laa-mock-oidc-service`.
     - Exposed on `http://localhost:9000` and align issuer/client details with your local Spring profile.
   - More details here: [laa-oidc-mock-server](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-oidc-mock-server#running-the-server-via-docker).


4. **Environment variables**
  ```sh
  export CLAIM_API_URL=http://localhost:8091
  export CLAIMS_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=dummy-token
  export REST_CLIENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5000
  export REST_CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT=40000
  export UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10MB
  export SERVER_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10MB
  ```
   - The example access token aligns with the WireMock fixtures; supply a real token when targeting non-mocked environments.
   - Update `AUTH_*` and `SILAS_*` variables to match either SILAS sandbox credentials or the mock server claims.

### Run the Application
```sh
./gradlew clean bootRun
```
- The UI is served on `http://localhost:8082`.
- Management endpoints are exposed on `http://localhost:8083`.
- Use `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local` if you maintain separate local overrides.

### Configuration
- Default configuration lives in `laa-submit-a-bulk-claim-ui/src/main/resources/application.yaml`.
- Override secrets via environment variables or Spring profiles. Kubernetes deployments source them from `laa-submit-a-bulk-claim-secrets` (see `helm-chart/values.yaml`).
- Upload limits can be adjusted with `UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE` and `SERVER_MAX_FILE_SIZE`.

## Testing
```sh
./gradlew test
```
- Controller and service layers are covered with MockMvc and unit tests.
- WireMock supports integration-style tests against Data Stewardship flows.
- Add new tests alongside changes to maintain coverage.

## Deployment
- GitHub Actions pipelines under `.github/workflows` build, scan, and publish Docker images.
  - `build-main.yml` tags merged changes on `main` and publishes artifacts.
  - `deploy-main.yml` produces release images, pushes to ECR, and triggers helm deployments.
- Kubernetes manifests are defined in `helm-chart/` with environment-specific overrides under `helm-chart/values/`.
- Deployments run on the MoJ Cloud Platform with ModSec ingress and pod security settings defined in chart values.

## Tooling & Conventions
- Follows MoJ coding standards; repository badge indicates compliance.
- Formatting and linting are inherited from shared Gradle conventions (`laa-ccms-spring-boot-gradle-plugin`).
- MapStruct mappers are generated at compile time; rebuild when DTOs change (`./gradlew clean assemble`).

## Documentation
- High-level flow diagrams are available in [`docs/flows`](docs/flows):
  - [`bulk-upload-flow.md`](docs/flows/bulk-upload-flow.md)
  - [`search-flow.md`](docs/flows/search-flow.md)
  - [`submission-detail-flow.md`](docs/flows/submission-detail-flow.md)
- Extend this folder with additional operational or support documentation as needed.
